            <i>I have contributed to the project in the following way: </i> <br>
            I have worked on the GroupMemberDTO-class. I have set up the <br>
            class with the required variables/functions so it can be used if<br>
            needed. I have also made the setup for the CarFacadeTest-class. Within<br>
            this class I have covered multiple tests, such as:<br>
            Adding, Counting, GettingbyId, GettingAll and "Empty-List-Testing"
       </p>

            <i>I have contributed to the project in the following way: </i> <br>
            I have in this project made most of the frontend for index, jokes and the cars page.<br>
            This also includes the JavaScript for these html pages.<br>
            I have also contributed with the getCarMake for the cars backEnd <br>
            and the endpoint for this<br>
            I have aswell made the tests for that methode and the endpoint. <br>

        <p style="text-align: center;"> 
            <i>I have contributed to the project in the following way: </i> <br>
            To begin with I created the endpoints for GroupMembers and Cars <br>
            and then proceeded to make the back end for Cars (Entity/Facade etc)<br>
            as well as Cars tests.<br>
            I have also contributed to the JavaScript that makes Cars run<br>
            on the page, as well as the layout for the HTML pages.</p>
