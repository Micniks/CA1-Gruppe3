            <i>I have contributed to the project in the following way: </i> <br>
            To begin with I created the endpoints for GroupMembers and Cars <br>
            and then proceeded to make the back end for Cars (Entity/Facade etc)<br>
            as well as Cars tests.<br>
            I have also contributed to the JavaScript that makes Cars run<br>
            on the page, as well as the layout for the HTML pages.</p>
